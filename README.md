#  Pockets✨💸

Pockets is a Web3 wallet built on **Stacks** that lets you split your single wallet into multiple **virtual sub-wallets** (called pockets).  
Think of it as budgeting on-chain — savings, bills, fun, goals — all inside one wallet without juggling multiple addresses.

- ✅ Deposit STX into specific pockets
